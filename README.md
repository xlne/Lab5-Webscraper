# Lab5-Webscraper

This is a school assignment where we created a WinForms application where the user can input the URL of a website and the program will save 
all of the pictures on that site, to a folder of the user's choice. (It's not perfectly working with all websites because that was not a 
requirement, we used the website of GÃ¶teborgs-Posten https://gp.se)
